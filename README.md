# Qué Prefieres

**Qué prefieres** is a web-app game made in AngularJS and Yeoman, with Grunt and Bower.


**Qué prefieres** is based on the popular drinking game **Would you rather** which consists on a series of questions asked to the user where he must chose between them. The questions have a score associated with them and after answering all of them the user is prompted with a description of his/her personality.
